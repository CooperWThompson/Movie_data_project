# Overview
Data was gathered from imdb(Internet Movie Database), tmdb(The Movie Database), and The Numbers database to find trends that lead to the most profitable and popular movies. Budget, genre, and release month were looked to see how they effect the profitability and popularity. We found postive trends to putting more money into a movie tends to lend more profit and popularity, but definitely isn't guaranteed. The fact that the same trend is send in profit and popularity is definitely encouraging to the accuracy of it. There was three genres that stood about all the others when combind the profit and popularity of each genre. In the same vein, there were three months that stood above and beyond all the others. With the trends seen in these three categories, we have solid recommendations to the best avenues to making movies.
# Business Problem
Microsoft is making their own movie studio, and they aproached us here at MMC(Money Making Corp.) with the question how do budget, genres, and release month affect the profitability and popularity of movies. After find the trends in the data, we have recommendations in all three of those avenues. With that said we do understand from a business side that nothing we say is a gaurentee that profit will be made. There is always inherent risk in the movie making industry, but we definitely have found trends that give higher chance to be successful.
# Data Understanding
As mentioned above in overview we gathered data from imdb(Internet Movie database), tmdb(The Movie database), and The numbers database. The data is not as complete as it could be and with more time, more data could be gathered for more accurate trends.
# Data Preparation
We then cleaned each of the dataframes we got from those sites. If you want to see the data cleaning steps we took, there is a notebook named Offical Data cleaning in Coopers notebook file. We took the data from each data frame and cleaned them up by taking the steps to make the gross and budget into integers. We then limited the data to only the movies that had at least $50,000 budget since mircrosoft is wanting to spend more than that on their projects. We had to turn the release date into dateTime format. We took steps to try and make sure all the formats for the movie titles were the same. We then went through the steps of merging the three tables together using the name of the movies and the release year. We had lots of duplicates that we dropped at this point. We realized we had some extreme outliers. We dealt with these by dropping any data points that were more than 3X the standard deviation above the mean in ROI (Return on Investment). Also dealt with the low end outliers by dropping the movies that had made less than \$50,000 in worldwide gross because in our research, most of these movies had false data in them. Also dropped the movies that had less than 75 minute runtimes because once again some of these movies had false data in them. Outside of the dropping duplicates and the merging of the tables, the most data points lost to any of these cleaning techniques was 31 movies. At the very end of the data cleaning, we were left with 1266 movies to work with.
